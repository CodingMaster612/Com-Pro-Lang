TO-DO LIST

- implement if, else and else if statements

- implement for loops


- implement for_loops register to the compiler

- implement if statements to register to compiler

- implement more variables

- add variables to main.cpp  line 100-117

- add variables to parser.cpp



LOG: write down what  you have tried to implement if else and else if statements

LOG: Try and failed to make if_state.cpp run with Parser.hpp and Parser.cpp by making the result change to result_state and adding 
expectStatement_state()  to Parser.hpp

LOG: tried to make another function call with if_state_call
did not work moving on to implementing brackets{} to if statement. currently works with if(x > 1) but not with  brackets {}

LOG: completed if statements and successfully ran the program with curly brackets {}

LOG: did not complete if statement because it registered as a function call and wanted curly brackets {} back to the drawing board.
